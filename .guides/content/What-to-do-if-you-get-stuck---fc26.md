If you find writing code to be a slow, mystifying, and painstaking process, filled with all kinds of opportunities to make mistakes, welcome to the world of a programmer! Perhaps to their exasperation, programmers spend the majority of their time hunting down and fixing bugs. Programmers also have to continually expand and adapt their skills to work with new languages and technologies, which requires research, practice, and lots of trial and error.

The best candidates for software engineering jobs are not the ones who list the most languages or acronyms on their resumes. Instead, the most desirable candidates are self-sufficient, meaning they know how to learn new things and find answers to problems on their own. This doesn't mean that they never ask for help; on the contrary, a good programmer knows when to stop banging his or her head against the wall and consult peers or a supervisor for advice. However, most everyday problems can be solved using the help documentation, online code examples, online forums, existing code that works, programming books, and debugging tools in the software.

In this section of the lesson, you'll learn about places where you can go for help when working with Python and when programming in general. You will have a much easier experience if you remember these resources and use them as you complete your assignments.
